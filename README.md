```

For this project tarted with the start code provided. I tweaked CSS, turning the textarea element to a class and changing the text in the from white to black. I used Bootstrap's grid to make the hour rows and Font Awesome to make the save button. jQuery was used for the save button on-click function and the function that checks whether an hour row needs the past, present, or future color. The application uses local storage and the user input presists.
